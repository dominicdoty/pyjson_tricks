Contributing
===============================

Contributions are very welcome! Bug reports, feature suggestions and code contributions help this project become more useful for everyone!

Contributing can be done through:

* Reporting bugs (issues_)
* Suggesting features (issues_)
* Fixing bugs (`pull request`_)
* Implementing features (`pull request`_)
* Reviewing a `pull request`_
* Telling a friend :)

There are only few things to keep in mind:

* Your contributions become `BSD-licensed`_
* Discuss features in an issue before contributing code.
* Automated tests are required to go live, not necessarily to commit.
* Try to follow the `code conventions`_.
* `Be nice`_.

Feel free to add yourself in the README if you send a pull request! Either at the specific feature ("thanks to NAME"), or in "Usage & contributions".
